**Work in progress**

## Get Started

This playground doesn't include any PHP best practices but rather intended to show some of the most simple examples and use cases of using the Appwrite API in your PHP application and server.

## System Requirements
* A system with PHP 8.5 or newer installed (required by the Appwrite PHP SDK 32.x).
* You have readily available Appwrite running instance (localhost in most cases).
* Create a project in Appwrite instance using console.
* Generate a secret key in the Appwrite instance using console.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. cd into to repository.
3. Copy the project_id, endpoint, and secret key from your Appwrite Console into the global.inc.php file.
4. Install dependencies using  composer (`composer install`).
5. Execute the command `php playground.php`
6. You will see the JSON response in the console.

### API Covered in Playground.
* Create Database
* Create Table
* List Tables
* Add Row
* List Rows
* Upload File
* List Files
* Create User
* List User
* Create Function, Deployment and Execution

### Tests
`tests/smoke.php` runs the playground against `tests/stub-server.php`, an Appwrite-shaped
stub, and asserts that every covered API method completes. It needs no Appwrite instance,
so it is the quickest way to check that an SDK upgrade did not rename a service, change a
parameter name or reshape a response model.

```
php tests/smoke.php
